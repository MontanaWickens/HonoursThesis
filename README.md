To run the automated files (auto.sh and auto_linux.sh) you will need DESPOT installed in the appropriate location. The python scripts generate_world_pomdpx_file.py and generate_fishery_pomdpx_file.py will run on any computer with python and create two pomdpx files which can be viewed like a txt file or given to DESPOT to solve. The script plot_results.py will run if line 93 is editted.
