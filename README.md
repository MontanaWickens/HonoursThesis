The python scripts generate_world_pomdpx_file.py and generate_fishery_pomdpx_file.py can be executed on any computer that can run python. The scripts will create two pomdpx files which can be viewed like a txt file or given to DESPOT to solve. To run the automated files (auto.sh and auto_linux.sh) you will need DESPOT installed in the appropriate location. The script plot_results.py can be executed if line 93 is edited to locate the DESPOT output file.
